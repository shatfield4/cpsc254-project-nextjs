## About The Project 

Workload distribution was distributed between 3 people focusing on concentrated areas such as front-end and back-end development.  We have distributed the workload as followed:
- Design: Rina
- API Handling: Rina Sean Cyrus
- Dynamic Page Routing: Rina Sean Cyrus
- Functionality: Sean Cyrus
- Database: Sean
- Testing: Rina Sean Cyrus


## Reasons & Requirments:
Front-end focused mainly on the design and little functionality to display to the user for best user experience when navigating through the site. Back-end handles routing and api calls that are able to talk to and grab information in order to display with the user across the various sites we are targeting. With the information we are able to grab and store it all into a dynamic database that will list: Name, Current_Price, & Before_Price.
